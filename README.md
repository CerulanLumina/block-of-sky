## Compatibility Goals
> What we want, not necessarily what we have
- Optifine: ***no.*** never.
- Sodium / Rubidium: Full compatibility
- Iris / Oculus: Basic support (no crashing, works when shaders are not enabled)
  - Support when using shaders is harder, so it's not a goal for me. I would accept PRs though.
